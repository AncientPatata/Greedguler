# Greedguler

#### TODO List :

- Generate dummy data (DAGs of varying size, associate durations with the different nodes to make them useable)
- Metrics: Implement the necessary functions for different metrics, as well as "automatic benchmarking" (use generated DAGs of varying size to benchmark the algorithm)
- Implement some basic sorting functions (look into ways to take dependencies between the different nodes into account)
- Implement the greedy algorithm
- Load the data into the program (passed in as commandline arguments alongside the number of machines)

- Look into parallelization
